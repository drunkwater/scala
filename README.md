## Simple Snippets




1. abstractTypes.scala	An example of how abstract types are used in a program


2. bigint.scala	User-defined integers, BigInts, are used seamlessly


3. complexOps.scala	Operators can be defined on user-defined classes, here complex numbers


4. for-yield.scala	An example of the for and yield constructs


5. extendBuiltins.scala	Adding "!" as a new method on integers


6. implicits.scala	Define a new method 'sort' on arrays without changing their definition


7. maps.scala	Maps are easy to use in Scala


8. match.scala	Using pattern matching to recognize command line arguments


9. primes.scala	A simple, although inefficient, way to calculate prime numbers


10. sum.scala	Calculates the sum of the arguments supplied on the command line


11. varargs.scala	Java varargs can be easily used in Scala as well




## Scala Examples - Advanced




1. addressbook.scala	Address book to XHTML code (see also XML Processing)


2. callccInterpreter.scala	Interpreter with continuations using monads


3. fors.scala	for comprehensions (see also Sequence Comprehensions)

5. lazyEvaluation.scala	Lazy evaluation


6. message.scala	Actors (see also Actors for Scala)


7. patterns.scala	Pattern matching using case classes (see also Case Classes)

10. properties.scala	Properties


11. random.scala	Client/server application using Java sockets


12. simpleInterpreter.scala	Simple interpreter using monads


13. sort.scala	Recursive quicksort algorithm (imperative solution, see also Nested Functions)


14. sort1.scala	Recursive quicksort algorithm (functional solution)


15. timeofday.scala	Properties (see example 1 in ยง 4.2 of the Scala Language Specification)


16. vectors.scala	Vector operations using views (see also Views)


17. brainf_ck.scala	A small Brainf*ck interpreter




# Notes




**Application** has been deprecated from **scala 2.9**, probably it has been deleted in **scala 2.11** (it still exists in scala 2.10) even though at the moment I can't find proofs for that, use **App** instead.
